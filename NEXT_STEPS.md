# 🚀 Next Steps - Quick Start Guide

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1️⃣ Set Up Firebase (15-20 minutes)

**Go to:** https://console.firebase.google.com/

#### For Android:
```bash
1. Create/Select your Firebase project
2. Click Android icon → Add Android app
3. Package name: com.example.empowerhealth
4. Download google-services.json
5. Move to: android/app/google-services.json
```

#### For iOS:
```bash
1. Click iOS icon → Add iOS app  
2. Bundle ID: com.example.empowerhealth
3. Download GoogleService-Info.plist
4. Move to: ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
```

#### Enable Services:
- ✅ Authentication → Email/Password
- ✅ Firestore Database → Create database (test mode)

### 2️⃣ Update Firebase Configuration

**File:** `lib/services/firebase_service.dart`

Replace the `_getFirebaseOptions()` method with your actual Firebase config values from:
- **Android:** `google-services.json`
- **iOS:** `GoogleService-Info.plist`

### 3️⃣ Update Android Build Files

**File:** `android/build.gradle.kts` (Add to buildscript dependencies):
```kotlin
classpath("com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.0")
```

**File:** `android/app/build.gradle.kts` (Add at bottom):
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.google.gms.google-services")
}
```

### 4️⃣ Test the App

```bash
flutter run
```

## Expected Flow

1. **Launch** → Auth Screen
2. **Sign Up** → Enter email/password
3. **Profile Creation** → Complete 7 steps:
   - Basic Info
   - Demographics
   - Health Info

   - Wellness & Access
   - Preferences
   - Goals
4. **Save** → Data stored in Firestore
