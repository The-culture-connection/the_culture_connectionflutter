- **Impact**: Faster onboarding, better UX, higher conversion

### Enhanced Search
- **Old (iOS)**: Basic name search only
- **New (Flutter)**: Multi-filter search (name, experience, skills offering, skills seeking)
- **Impact**: Better user discovery, improved matching quality

### Skills System
- **Old (iOS)**: Generic skills list
- **New (Flutter)**: 10 categorized skill groups with 66 total skills
- **Impact**: Better professional matching, clearer skill identification

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining high-priority features (Events, Business Directory, Profile Management)
2. Implement matching algorithm
3. Add rewards system
4. Set up push notifications
5. Implement analytics
6. Test thoroughly on both iOS and Android
7. Submit to App Store and Play Store
